# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code 2018 :santa:

## Haskell

Every day lives in its own module. Call the CLI with the day (as a number) and the filepath of the data. Alternatively, supply data via stdin. As always, `aoc2018 -h` helps :)

`aoc2018 -d 1 -f link/to/data`

## Rust

Hopefully I have time :|
